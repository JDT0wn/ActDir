<h1>Active Directory Basics</h1>

<p>
Active Directory Deployment and User Management Lab
Platform: VirtualBox | Technologies Used: Windows Server 2019, Windows 10, PowerShell
</p>

Project Overview:
In this lab, I deployed a Windows 10 client system in VirtualBox and connected it to a Windows Server 2019 machine configured as a Domain Controller. The primary goal was to set up and manage Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) in a simulated enterprise environment.
