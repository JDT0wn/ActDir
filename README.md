<h1>Active Directory Basics</h1>

<p>
Active Directory Deployment and User Management Lab
Platform: VirtualBox | Technologies Used: Windows Server 2019, Windows 10, PowerShell

Project Overview:
In this lab, I deployed a Windows 10 client system in VirtualBox and connected it to a Windows Server 2019 machine configured as a Domain Controller. The primary goal was to set up and manage Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) in a simulated enterprise environment.

Key Tasks and Skills Demonstrated:

Deployed and configured a Windows Server 2019 instance as a domain controller.

Installed and managed Active Directory, enabling centralized user and computer management.

Used PowerShell scripting to automate the creation of 1,000+ user accounts in bulk, simulating enterprise-scale onboarding.

Demonstrated administrative tasks, including:

Searching for and managing user accounts

Disabling inactive or compromised accounts

Unlocking user accounts after failed login lockouts

Verifying permissions and ensuring proper account access policies
