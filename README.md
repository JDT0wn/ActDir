<h1>Active Directory Basics Vid</h1>

<p>
In this video i use virtualbox to deploy a windows 10 client that will be connecting to winserver19 configured as a domain controller. After we will deploy and configure active directory adding a list of over 1000 users via powershell scripting, and then we will be find users, demonstrate how to disable accounts, unlock accounts that have reached the max login attempts, and more.
